# Gnome Calculator

Query results from qalc [qalc](https://github.com/Qalculate/libqalculate), requires [qalculate-gtk](https://github.com/Qalculate/qalculate-gtk) for Alt-Enter to open qalculate)

Unfortunately, qalculate-gtk doesn't seem to be able to pass an expression in upon opening, so Alt-Enter only opens a blank expression for now.
